PN expansion of the spin-precession invariant for eccentric-orbit EMRIs to 9PN and e^16 (2022)

This repository contains different forms for the expansion of the spin-precession invariant for Schwarzschild EMRIs to 9PN, as a supplement to the paper arXiv:2206.04085.  In general, each PN term is given as an expansion in eccentricity to e^16, though a few lower-order terms are found in closed or compact form.  The series are contained within text files, with the files “pSeries” and “ySeries” showing expansions in 1/p and y, respectively.  The series can be loaded by using Mathematica’s Get[] function, for example Get[“<file-path>/pSeries9PNe16”].
